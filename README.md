## Talatu Jalloh

**Doctoral Student in Economics**  
*Kobe University, Japan*

I am a doctoral student in Economics at Kobe University with research interests in work-based and experiential learning, entrepreneurship, and development economics. My work focuses on evaluating education and internship-based interventions—particularly the **African Business Education Initiative (ABEI)**—using survey data and quasi-experimental methods.

My doctoral research examines how **purpose-oriented work-based learning** influences entrepreneurial aspirations and the likelihood of starting a business among African graduate scholars. I am especially interested in alternative, non-discipline-specific pathways for developing entrepreneurial capabilities in developing-country contexts.

**Research interests**
- Work-based and experiential learning  
- Entrepreneurship and entrepreneurial aspirations  
- Program evaluation and causal inference  
- Development economics  
- Japan–Africa cooperation and international education
